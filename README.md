react-webpack-nodejs-starterkit
===========

The master branch of this repo is a starter kit that uses React without any flux frameworks and integrates it with an application level express server that is configured to hot reload your react componets in `development` environment.

- For use with redux, check out the [redux-integrations](https://github.com/tutorialhorizon/react-webpack-nodejs-starterkit/tree/redux-integrations) branch.

#### npm scripts
```
$ npm run hot-dev
```
Watches for changes to your react components in the `/flux` directory as well as sets up nodemon to watch your `/server` directory and automatically reloads everything!

```
$ npm run dev
```
Run this when you dont want any file watching but need to use development configuration from `/configs/index.js`

```
$ npm run prod
```
Run this when you want production configuration from `/config/index.js` and production settings for webpack.

See the package.json scripts section for more details on the scripts.
